# Facedetection-TensorBox
Face Detection using deep learning and tensorBox

This development is to detect faces on images using deep learning. It uses TensorBox for training. Output of this algorithm is localization of the faces present in image. The accuracy and performance is sufficiently good but could be further optimized.
